# Heart of Frogg

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/jessemillar/heart-of-frogg)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/jessemillar/heart-of-frogg) [![Man Hours](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmh.jessemillar.com%2Fhours%3Frepo%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjessemillar%2Fheart-of-frogg.git)](https://jessemillar.com/r/man-hours)

I wanted a way to display my heart rate live on [my Twitch stream](http://jessemillar.com/r/twitch) using [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). There was not a current method for doing that so Heart of Frogg was born!
